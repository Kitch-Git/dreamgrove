# Using Alerts in MDX

This guide demonstrates how to use alert components in your MDX content.

## Basic Alerts

You can use alerts in two ways:

### 1. Using the Alert Component Directly

You can use the Alert component directly in your MDX:

<Alert type="info">
  This is an info alert. It provides general information to the reader.
</Alert>

<Alert type="warning">
  This is a warning alert. It warns the reader about potential issues.
</Alert>

<Alert type="error">
  This is an error alert. It indicates something that's incorrect or problematic.
</Alert>

<Alert type="success">
  This is a success alert. It indicates a successful operation or positive outcome.
</Alert>

<Alert type="note">
  This is a note alert. It provides additional notes or tips.
</Alert>

### 2. Using GitHub-style Blockquote Syntax

Alternatively, you can use GitHub-style blockquote syntax:

> [!INFO]
> This is an info alert using blockquote syntax.
> 
> It can span multiple paragraphs.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a warning alert using blockquote syntax.

> [!ERROR]
> This is an error alert using blockquote syntax.

> [!SUCCESS]
> This is a success alert using blockquote syntax.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a note alert using blockquote syntax.

## Alerts with Custom Titles

You can also add custom titles to your alerts:

<Alert type="info" title="Custom Info Title">
  This is an info alert with a custom title.
</Alert>

<Alert type="warning" title="Important Warning">
  This is a warning alert with a custom title.
</Alert>

## Alerts with Rich Content

Alerts can contain rich content, including links, code, and more:

<Alert type="info">
  You can include [links](https://example.com) in your alerts.
  
  You can also include code snippets:
  
  ```js
  function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }
  ```
  
  And lists:
  
  - Item 1
  - Item 2
  - Item 3
</Alert>

## When to Use Alerts

- **Info alerts**: Use for general information, tips, or additional context
- **Warning alerts**: Use to warn users about potential issues or things to be careful about
- **Error alerts**: Use to highlight errors, problems, or incorrect approaches
- **Success alerts**: Use to indicate successful operations or positive outcomes
- **Note alerts**: Use for additional notes, tips, or asides

Alerts help make your content more scannable and highlight important information for your readers.
