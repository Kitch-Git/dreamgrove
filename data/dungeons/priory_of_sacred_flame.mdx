- You can choose to fight either <Wowhead type="npc" id="239834"/> or <Wowhead type="npc" id="239833"/> with the boss. <Wowhead type="npc" id="239834"/>'s !424462|Ember Storm! is pretty deadly, especially in pugs, so leaving <Wowhead type="npc" id="239833"/> alive and deling with !424431|Holy Radiance! is recommended.
- [*Resto] Save healing CDs for <Wowhead type="npc" id="239833"/>'s !424431|Holy Radiance!.
- The bosses share HP, so use AoE abilities.
